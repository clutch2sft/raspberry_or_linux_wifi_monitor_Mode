# raspberry_or_linux_wifi_monitor_Mode
Quick hooks script to enable monitor mode by default on all but the first wifi adapter

This script is for DHCPCD based systems to detect additional wifi adapters and throw them into monitor mode.  

I found a ton of help on the net for the setup on none DHCPCD based systems and spent a fair amount of time figuring this out.   

Your mileage my vary good luck!
